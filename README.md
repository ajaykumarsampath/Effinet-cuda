# Effinet-cuda
The Effinet-cuda repository containts the CUDA-C implementation of 
accelerated proximal gradient (APG) to solve the dual problem of the 
stocahstic model predictive optimisation problem for the management
of water networks of Barcelona as a part of the EFFINET project. 
Detailed explaination about theory and algorithm was discussed 
in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01074.
